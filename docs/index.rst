   :description lang=en: Static site generator for WordPress.

`Static HTML Output <https://statichtmloutput.com>`_ is a static site generator for WordPress.
A static site benefits from increased security, performance and portability.
It often allows for greatly reduced hosting costs, with many free static site hosts now available.

Open Source with no restrictions
    Our code is free and `open source <https://github.com/WP2Static/statichtmloutput/>`_.
    Public domain'd via `The Unlicense <https://https://unlicense.org/>`_, so you can
    rebrand it and sell it for profit, use it behind the scenes in your hosting company
    or embed it in your smart-refrigerator. We can't restrict how you'll use it, but
    hope you'll use it to add some real value to the world.
