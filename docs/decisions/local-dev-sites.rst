Local development sites
=======================

Hosting on your own computer or a local server is safe way to run your WordPress 
site, away from the public and with all the power of your laptop/desktop/raspberryPi, etc!

Lokl
----

One of our developers is working on a local WordPress development 
environment, made specifically for WordPress to static website usage. 
`Check out Lokl <https://lokl.dev>`_.

   I wasn't happy with any of the 1-click local WordPress
   environments, that would work well across OS's and suit
   ideal WordPress to static site workflows.

   One day, I finally figured out a way to design it simply - Lokl!
